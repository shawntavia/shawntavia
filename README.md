👋🏽 Hello, I’m @shawntavia
I'm a Business Applications Analyst in Mobile, AL. Before my current role, I worked as a Jr. Sys Admin. I learn new hands-on skills every day, and I'm looking to broaden my knowledge. 

✍🏽 I’m interested in Data and Cybersecurity. 

🌱 I started learning Web development from Skillcrush in 2022. I've completed the HTML/CSS and GIT courses. I took a break from Skillcrush to study for CompTIA Security+ and passed in late February 2023.  I finished a Computer Science course from Edx(Harvardx CS50) in March 2023.  I'm now in my current BAA role and will pivot with learning JDE, SQL and later Python.

💡 I’m looking to collaborate on SQL and Python projects. Now that I have my Sec+, I would love to further my knowledge and get more hands-on experience with smaller cybersecurity projects. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure yet. I'm new to Git and GitHub, so I don't know what I can collaborate on, or all GitHub has to offer.
