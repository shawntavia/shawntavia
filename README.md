👋🏽 Hello, I’m @shawntavia
I'm a help desk technician in Mobile, AL. Before my current role, I worked as a Case Manager for Elderly/Disabled persons. I learn new hands-on skills every day, and I'm looking to broaden my knowledge. 

✍🏽 I’m interested in Web development and Cybersecurity. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Web development from Skillcrush and Network+ from Infosec/CompTIA. I've completed the HTML/CSS intro course, and I'm currently working on GIT lessons. Later I will start responsive web and finally, Javascript

💡 I’m looking to collaborate on HTML and CSS projects. Emails. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure yet. I'm new to Git and GitHub, so I don't know what I can collaborate on, or all GitHub has to offer.
